# Lung_Cancer_Shrinkage_vs_Erosion

This repository contains code for Rhydian Windsor and George Needham's MPhys project investigating the use of CT scans to classify whether a lung cancer tumour is shrinking or eroding. The idea involves observing changes in Hounsfeld units at the edge of the tumour during a radiotherapy course in the hope of observing two modes of decay.

Most of the code here won't make sense without the relevant data however this can't be made available for patient confidentiality reason
